RL Research Directions

- Research direction
1, systematic, comparative study of deep RL algorithms, is about reproducibility, and under
the surface, about stability and convergence properties of deep RL algorithms. 

- Research direction
2, ”solve” multi-agent problems, is usually about sample efficiency, sparse reward, stability, nonstationarity,
and convergence in a large-scale, complex setting, a frontier in AI research. 

- Research
direction 3, learn from entities, but not just raw inputs, is about sample efficiency, sparse reward,
and interpretability, by incorporating more knowledge, structure, and inductive bias. 

- Research direction 4, design an optimal representation for RL.

- Research direction 5, AutoRL .

- Research direction 6, develop killer applications for (deep) RL, are about the whole RL problem, about all
issues in RL, like credit assignment, sparse reward, time/space/sample efficiency, accuracy, stability,
convergence, interpretability, safety, scalability, robustness, simplicity, etc, from different angles
of representation, automation, and application, respectively.

- Detect if someone is using a covert breakthrough AI system in the world. As the number of organizations and resources allocated to AI research increases, the probability increases that an organization will make an undisclosed AI breakthrough and use the system for potentially malicious ends. It seems important to detect this. We can imagine a lot of ways to do this — looking at the news, financial markets, online games, etc.

- Build an agent to win online programming competitions. A program that can write other programs would be, for obvious reasons, very powerful.

- Cyber-security defense. An early use of AI will be to break into computer systems. We’d like AI techniques to defend against sophisticated hackers making heavy use of AI methods.

- A complex simulation with many long-lived agents. We’re interested in building a very large simulation with lots of different agents in it that can interact with each other, learn over a long period of time, discover language, and accomplish a rich variety of goals.

Challenges of DL:
 
- Big data analytics using Deep Learning
- Scalability of DL approaches
- Ability to generate data which is important where data is
not available for learning the system (especially for
computer vision task such as inverse graphics).
- Energy efficient techniques for special purpose devices
including mobile intelligence, FPGAs, and so on.
- Multi-task and transfer learning (generalization) or
multi-module learning. This means learning from
different domains or with different models together.
- Dealing with causality in learning.
